#  Main Obsidian Config
Since I'm on Arch, this will be my main config which will include all the plugins, themes, Icon Packs, Images, Banners and everything I could possibly work on while maintaining my vault

If you're using Arch like me, you could simply install it from arch repository 
`sudo pacman -S Obsidian`

or even better, use Snap Installer to make sure you don't have to hastle through dependency hell


`sudo snap install obsidian --classic`
