#### Fullstack DevOps Journey with Electron, Docker & K3s

## Phase 1: Build Your App (Electron + React + Tailwind)

Scaffold a basic Electron app

Set up Vite or Webpack (your choice)

Integrate React into Electron

Add Tailwind CSS styling

Build out core UI/pages

Add any functionality (e.g. note-taking, task manager, etc.)

## Test your desktop app on your machine

üê≥ Phase 2: Dockerize the App

Write a Dockerfile for your Electron app

Use node:alpine or similar as base image

Add a .dockerignore file

Build your Docker image locally

Run and test the image in a container

Push the image to GitHub Container Registry

Create a GitHub personal access token

Login using docker login ghcr.io

Tag your image as ghcr.io/username/repo-name:tag

        Push to the registry

## Phase 3: Run K3s Locally (with k3d)

Install Docker (if not already)

Install k3d:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

Create a test cluster:
k3d cluster create mycluster

Verify it's running:
kubectl get nodes

Deploy your image:

Create Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)

        Apply with kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

## Phase 4: Learn & Understand Kubernetes

Understand what a Pod is

Understand Deployments & ReplicaSets

Learn Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer

Create and test port forwarding

Learn kubectl logs, kubectl exec, kubectl describe

    Test app lifecycle: scale, delete, restart

## Phase 5: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Create .github/workflows/docker.yml

Build Docker image on push

Push image to GitHub Container Registry

    Optionally deploy to your local k3d cluster using webhook or kubectl actions

## Bonus: React Native Port (Optional)

Extract shared business logic to common JS/TS modules

Scaffold React Native app

Reuse UI components where possible

Test on Android/iOS emulator

    Evaluate React Native Desktop (if you want one shared codebase)

üìå Tips & Reminders

    Use k9s for terminal-based Kubernetes management

    Use Obsidian Canvas to map architecture

    Use GitHub Projects (or Obsidian Tasks plugin) to organize workflow

    Don't aim for perfection ‚Äî just iteration
